Mesosphir is a UGC game created in Unity 5. Users can design and create their own levels, and upload them to a play browser for other users to play.

Mesosphir is heavily based on Atmosphir, which had essentially the same gameplay. In 2012, the company behind the original Atmosphir game went bankrupt, causing the game and its servers to shut down. The community resurrected the game in 2013, and built a new server which allowed for its continued enjoyment by players. However, as it currently stands, there is no ability to add new blocks or features into the game. This project aims to fix that by faithfully re-writing the game from scratch.

Mesophir also has a website at http://mesosphir.com, but there really isn't anything on it yet.
